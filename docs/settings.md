# Settings & Configuration

Kika provides a Settings window to customize the overlay's behavior and appearance.

## Accessing Settings

To open the settings window:

- **Right-click** on the Kika tray icon (if available).
- Or, press `Cmd + Opt + k` while the app is focused (if applicable, though Kika is mostly background).
- _Currently, the most reliable way is often via the tray icon or development tools if running in dev mode._

## Positioning

Control where Kika sits on your screen.

### Preset Mode

Locks Kika to a specific location.

- **Bottom Center**: The default. Keeps Kika centered at the bottom of your primary display.

### Free Mode

Allows you to drag and drop Kika anywhere.

- **To Drag**: Click and hold anywhere on the cat overlay.
- **Note**: When "Click-through" is enabled, you cannot drag the window. You must disable click-through first.

## Appearance

- **Opacity**: Adjust the transparency. Helpful if you want Kika to be less obtrusive.

## Behavior

- **Click-through**: When enabled, mouse clicks will pass through Kika to the window behind it. This is great for keeping Kika on top of your work without blocking interaction.
  - **To Disable**: You need to open the Settings window and toggle it off.

## Input Tracking

- **Reset Count**: Resets the ongoing tally of keypresses and mouse clicks.
